# generic-jsontable
produce table from json file, without knowing the content or structure. recursive javascript code

- ids, class, table, tablehead, tablebody, tablerow, tabledata are generated by javascript
- indenting, color, visual grouping shall be done by css
- keys with objects as values are set alone

still to be done:
- recurring properties (keys) are not grouped together
- maybe subtables in maintable
- switches for design or table outcome
- one function or class, the three function should cooperate better
- parameter logic should be straighter
